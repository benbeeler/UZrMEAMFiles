# UZrMEAMFiles

This repository contains the U-Zr MEAM potential in the article: "Atomistic modeling of high temperature uraniumâ€“zirconium alloy structure and thermodynamics" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnucmat.2015.10.016

The library.meam and the UZr.meam files are required by LAMMPS and described the UZr potential.

The meam.h.edits file contains the necessary edits to the meam.h file in the /lammps/src/MEAM folder for proper implementation of the potential. 

Please route all questions to Benjamin Beeler at bwbeeler@ncsu.edu or benjamin.beeler@gmail.com
